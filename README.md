# Parts to Print

## 1x Shield Mount
This part can be printed as a whole, standing up. A little carfull bending will losen the hinge. Clean it with something pointy like a flat head screwdriver.

## 1x Bottom and Top Clamp
The notches in the top clamp part need to be printed with support structures and then cleaned with a screwdrive or something hook-y. This is tedious, but it did fit for me in the end.


## 16x OpenBuilds Connector

Maybe you need to scale this, see instructions!


# Assemble

## Base
Use the OpenBuild Connectors and a little persuasian with a hammer to connect the profiles to form a base.

## Stem
Mount the stem with the angle at the 5th shorter profile.

## Shield Mount
Mount the shield mount with two nuts and bolts at the 7th profile.

## Shield
Drill the holes according to the drawing or use a laser cuttter and the provided DXF file.
Cut 4 Rings and 6 Ribs out of the MDF according to the pattern in the PDF directory. 
Glue the bending rig together with hotglue or whatever you have at hand.
Without removing the protective layer from the plexiglass sheet, wedge the sheet in the bending rig.
*Make sure that the long end is pointing upwards.*
Start heating up the sheet and smooth, horizontal movements until the sheet starts bending. Work your way up until the sheet is completely bend around the rig.

After cooling, mount the Shield on the shield mount using the M5X10 screws.

## Clamp
Squeece 4 Nuts in the recesses of the clamp base. Mount the base on the gantry plate.
Clamp the pressure filler between the clamp base and top using 4 screws, tightening them carefulle and diagonally.
Slide the gantry on the stem.
